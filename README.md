# PFAS-Contamination-Clustering-and-Severity-Analysis


This project performs clustering and severity classification of PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) contamination data using unsupervised learning techniques and geospatial visualization.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding patterns and severity levels of various PFAS compounds across different geographic locations. It includes:

- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA  
- K-Means clustering  
- Severity scoring based on compound impact  
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Folium
